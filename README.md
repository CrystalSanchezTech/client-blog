Find a background image to use for the body of the site as well as a actual post. Set up our document using semantic divs, as well as entering all necessary HTML tags to link to an external style sheet. Enter all content and images, then style page, use inspect element to troubleshoot.  Our minimum requirements were 2 images, 2 fonts, 2 different hex code colors, a background image and 2 buttons
